For example, we need analysis tools such as GA/umami to check pv/uv and the number of visits to each page, we need an uptime monitor to check the network quality and connectivity of the server, and we need to use prometheus to obtain the status reported by the server to check the quality of the server. In addition, if we develop an application that allows open source deployment, we often need a telemetry system to help us collect the simplest information about other people's deployment situations. I think these tools should serve the same purpose, so is there an application that can integrate these common needs in a lightweight way? After all, most of the time we don't need very professional and in-depth functions. But in order to achieve comprehensive monitoring, I need to install so many services. It's good to specialize in one thing, if we are experts in related abilities we need such specialized tools. But for most users who only have lightweight needs, an All-in-One application will be more convenient and easier to use.</p>\n<p><b>Author:</b> BigBearTechWorld | <b>Version:</b> 1.30.6 | <b>Default Port:</b> 12345</p>\n<p><i>Source: CasaOS App Store (bigbeartechworld/big-bear-casaos)</i></p>",

Since Traefik reads the Docker containers it automatically searches for an open port and makes it available.\n\nBy default Traefik will use port `81` for `HTTP`, port `443` for `HTTPS` and port `8080` for the dashboard. If you want to use port `80` for `HTTP`, then you have first to change the WebUI port of CasaOS first under the settings in the top left menu. After deploying the container you can change the port mapping from `81` to `80`.\n\nVisit [Traefik Labs](https://traefik.io) for more details.

Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages. See : COPS's home for more details. Don't forget to check the Wiki. ## Why? (taken from the author's site) In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much dependencies to be used for its content server. That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case). I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no search was possible. Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo. So COPS's main advantages are : * No need for many dependencies. * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM. * Not much code. * Search is available. * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server. * It was fun to code. If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify /feed at the end of your URL.</p>\n<p><b>Author:</b> WisdomSky | <b>Version:</b> 3.6.5 | <b>Default Port:</b> 80</p>\n<p><i>Source: CasaOS App Store (WisdomSky/CasaOS-LinuxServer-AppStore)</i></p>",

It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. \n\n- Code Hosting\nGitea supports creating and managing repositories, browsing commit history and code files, reviewing and merging code submissions, managing collaborators, handling branches, and more. It also supports many common Git features such as tags, Cherry-pick, hooks, integrated collaboration tools, and more.\n\n- Lightweight and Fast\nOne of Gitea's design goals is to be lightweight and fast in response. Unlike some large code hosting platforms, it remains lean, performing well in terms of speed, and is suitable for resource-limited server environments. Due to its lightweight design, Gitea has relatively low resource consumption and performs well in resource-constrained environments.\n\n- Easy Deployment and Maintenance\nIt can be easily deployed on various servers without complex configurations or dependencies. This makes it convenient for individual developers or small teams to set up and manage their own Git services.\n\n- Security\nGitea places a strong emphasis on security, offering features such as user permission management, access control lists, and more to ensure the security of code and data.\n\n- Code Review\nCode review supports both the Pull Request workflow and AGit workflow. Reviewers can browse code online and provide review comments or feedback. Submitters can receive review comments and respond or modify code online. Code reviews can help individuals and organizations enhance code quality.\n\n- CI/CD\nGitea Actions supports CI/CD functionality, compatible with GitHub Actions. Users can write workflows in familiar YAML format and reuse a variety of existing Actions plugins. Actions plugins support downloading from any Git website.\n\n- Project Management\nGitea tracks project requirements, features, and bugs through columns and issues. Issues support features like branches, tags, milestones, assignments, time tracking, due dates, dependencies, and more.\n\n- Artifact Repository\nGitea supports over 20 different types of public or private software package management, including Cargo, Chef, Composer, Conan, Conda, Container, Helm, Maven, npm, NuGet, Pub, PyPI, RubyGems, Vagrant, and more.\n\n- Open Source Community Support\nGitea is an open-source project based on the MIT license. It has an active open-source community that continuously develops and improves the platform. The project also actively welcomes community contributions, ensuring updates and innovation.\n\n- Multilingual Support\nGitea provides interfaces in multiple languages, catering to users globally and promoting internationalization and localization.\n</p>\n<p><b>Author:</b> CasaOS Team | <b>Version:</b> 1.24.6 | <b>Default Port:</b> 3000</p>\n<p><i>Source: CasaOS App Store (IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore)</i></p>",

By setting it up, you can block ads and trackers across all your home devices without needing to install any additional software on each device. This means comprehensive protection with minimal effort.\n\nHow AdGuard Home Works and How to Use It. AdGuard Home functions as a DNS server that reroutes tracking domains to a \"black hole,\" effectively preventing your devices from connecting to these servers. This blocks ads and trackers not only on your computer but also on your smartphone and smart home devices. To start using AdGuard Home, deploy it on your device, then change the DNS address assigned by DHCP on your router to the IP address of your AdGuard Home server.\n\nBenefits of Deploying AdGuard Home on Zima Private Cloud. Deploying AdGuard Home on a Zima device simplifies network-wide ad and tracker blocking, providing a seamless and secure browsing experience for all your home devices. With Zima, you gain the flexibility to monitor network activity and create custom filtering rules tailored to your needs.\n</p>\n<p><b>Author:</b> CasaOS Team | <b>Version:</b> v0.107.61 | <b>Default Port:</b> 53</p>\n<p><i>Source: CasaOS App Store (IceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore)</i></p>",
